# onesignal

Push
## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for implementing onesignal implementation in flutter.

- It uses external user id for creating push notification.
- You can see how to configure your app to use id specific to your user such as user id to send notifications.
- It has a custom backend based on golang named onesignal-backend. You can find it in my repo.
